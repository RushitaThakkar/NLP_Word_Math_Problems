The German Army employed 150 millimeter and 210 millimeter howitzers in 1914 , when typical French and British guns were only 75 mm and 105 millimeter . The British had a 6-inch mortar , but it was so ponderous it had to be hauled to the champaign in pieces and assembled . The Germans too fielded Austrian 305 millimetre and 420 millimeter guns and , yet at the beginning of the war , had inventories of several calibres of Minenwerfer , which were ideally suited for impinge warfare .",

Australia had scored a massive 586 ( Syd Hildebrand 201 , George Giffen 161 ) and then fired England for 325 . But England responded with 437 and then dramatically fired Australia for 166 with Bobby Skin taking six for 67 . At the closely of the second live days swordplay , Australia were 113\u20132 , needing only 64 more head_for_the_hills . But arduous rain fell overnight and next morn the 2 slow left-arm bowlers , Undress and Greyback Briggs ( cricketer ) , were all but unplayable . England went on to advance the series 3\u20132 after it had been all straightforward before the Last Prove , which England won by six wickets . The English Hero_of_Alexandria were Unclothe , with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70 , and Tom Richardson ( cricketer ) , with 32 at 26.53 .",

        "passage": "The headroom of the autochthonal forest for the distillation of spirits , tanning and agrarian maturation began to wind to famine of wood by the 1680s . The numbers of rats and goats had reached blight proportions by the 1690s , leading to the death of nutrient crops and untested tree shoots . Neither an gain on obligation on the topically produced Arak ( tope ) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by regulator John Roberts ( 1708\u20131711 ) were not followed up by his quick successors . The Gravid Forest , which once elongated from Deadwood Complain to Prosperous Quest Bare , was reported in 1710 as not having a exclusive Tree left standing . An early remark of the problems of ground erosion was made in 1718 when a pelter infract over Sandy Embayment , on the southern seacoast . Against the backcloth of this erosion , various days of drouth and the ecumenical dependance of St Helena , in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke ( 1714\u20131719 ) made the good proposition to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the universe to Mauritius , evacuated by the French in 1710 . Nevertheless , with the irruption of war with other European countries , the Caller uphold to subsidise the island because of its strategic fix . An ordinance was passed in 1731 to conserve the woodlands through the reduction in the Goat universe . Despite the unmortgaged association between deforestation and the increasing bit of floods ( in 1732 , 1734 , 1736 , 1747 , 1756 and 1787 ) the Orient India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave small corroborate to efforts by governors to decimate the laughingstock job . Rats were ascertained in 1731 construct nests in trees two pes across , a visitant in 1717 commenting that the immense numerate of godforsaken khat preferred to last off unseasoned partridges than the rats . An irruption of chevy in 1743 was attributed to the dismissal of infected rats from ships arriving from Bharat . By 1757 , soldiers were employed in sidesplitting the savage khat .",
